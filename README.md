# Tic-Tac-Toe (with AI)

## How to run

Simply run make

```bash
make
```

and then execute the binary

```bash
./game
```

## What's inside

A tic-tac-toe game with a computer opponent. Not interesting, you say? Trivial by using a lookup table? Yes, you're absolutely correct! In an effort to add some elegance through complexity, the implementation here does search the state space by building a game tree.

## Anything else?

Yes -- it doesn't work right now. State: will score the game tree correctly.
